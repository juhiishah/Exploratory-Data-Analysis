# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Performing EDA on Crimes Against Women in India in the span of 2001-2014
Through this project, we tried to analyse and find out statistically how different types of crimes against women have been reported and evolved over a given period, whether the situation has gotten worse or improved at some level, which states had the worst reported cases etc. We have raise questions related to the dataset provided and answer them as well through this project, to find out more about the situation in India, state-wise and crime-category wise as well!
